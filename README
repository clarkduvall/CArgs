CArgs parses command line arguments given to a C++ program and allows you to
easily check which arguments have been specified. It allows defaults to be set
for arguments of the form '-x 0' or '--x 0'. It also preserves the order of
arguments not beginning with a '-'.

For example, running the command:

   test --bob 5 -asd -g 2.4 out

would set create an Args object with this mapping:

bob => 5
a => 0
s => 0
d => 0
g => 2.4

These can be checked and retrieved with the HasOption() and GetInt() or 
GetDouble() functions.

"out" would be the first argument in the argument vector, which can be
retrieved with GetArg().

The Makefile will make the cargs library as well as cargs-tests, a test
suite for CArgs. Look at the Makefile for how to link libcargs.a.
